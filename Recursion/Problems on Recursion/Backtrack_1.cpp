//Problem: Print Linearly from 1 to N  using backtracking

// This is an alternative approach for printing the integers from 1 to N using recursion. 
// In the previous approach, we used forward recursion but in this approach, we will be 
// using backward recursion. The only change from the previous approach here will be that 
// the print line would be kept after the function call inside the recursive function 
// contrary to the previous approach. The function would be called for printing (i-1) 
// integers and the nth integer would be printed.
